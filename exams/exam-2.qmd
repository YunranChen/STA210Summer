## Rules & Notes

-   This is an individual assignment. Everything in your repository and on Sakai is for your eyes only.

-   You may not collaborate or communicate anything about this exam to **anyone** except the instructor and the TA). For example, you may not communicate with other students or post/solicit help on the internet, email or via any other method of communication.

-   The exam is open-book, open-note, so you may use any materials from class as you take the exam.

-   If you have questions, email the professor or the TA on Slack or post on Sakai Conversations for "Instructors in this site" only or attend my office hours.

## Submission

-   **Part 1 - Conceptual:** The answers to the multiple choice/short answer questions should be submitted under *Test & Quizzes* in Sakai.

-   **Part 2 - Applied:** The PDF document for the data analysis portion must be uploaded to Gradescope.

    -   You must submit a PDF to Gradescope that corresponds to the `.qmd` file on your GitHub repository in order to receive credit for this portion of the exam.

    -   You must upload a PDF, not HTML. Any non-PDF submissions will **not** be graded.

    -   Mark the pages associated with each question. If any answer for a question spans multiple pages, mark all associated pages.

    -   Make sure to associate the "Workflow & formatting" section with the first page.

    -   Failure to mark the pages in Gradescope will result in point deductions. Any pages that are not marked will **not** be graded.
