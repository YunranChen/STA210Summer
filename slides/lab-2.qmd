## **Notes from lab 1**

-   Great job selecting pages when submitting on Gradescope

-   Check for comments on our work, even if you didn't lose points

-   Read the syllabus if you haven't!


## **Code Style**

-   To make code easier to read and debug, try:

    -   Putting each element on a different line ('enter' after + signs, etc.)
    
    -   Putting spaces before and after operators (+,-,*,=)

## Start your work

Go to the [STA210-Summer22](https://www.github.com/STA210-Summer22) organization on GitHub. Click on the repo with the prefix **lab-2**. It contains the starter documents you need to complete the lab.
