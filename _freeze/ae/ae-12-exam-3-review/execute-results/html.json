Why should we use a logistic regression model for this analysis?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nclaws %>%\n  distinct(lb)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 2 Ã— 1\n  lb   \n  <fct>\n1 0    \n2 1    \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Exercise 3\n\nWe will use the mean-centered variables for force (`force\\_cent`) in the model. Use logistic regression to fit the model. Obtain its confidence interval and knit it to a table presenting only 3 digits. Write the equation of the model produced by R.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nLet $\\pi$ be probability that a crab is from Lb species, write down the model formula based on your result.\n\n\n\n## Exercise 4\n\nInterpret the intercept in the context of the data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Exercise 5\n\nInterpret the effect of force in the context of the data.\n\nWhen x goes up by 1 unit, we expect y to change by (slope) units.\n\n\n## Exercise 6\n\nNow let's consider adding `height_cent` to the model. Fit the model that includes `height_cent`. Then use AIC to choose the model that best fits the data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Exercise 7\n\nWhat do the following mean in the context of this data. Explain and calculate them.\n\n-   Sensitivity: P(predict lb \\| actual lb) = \n-   Specificity: P(predict not lb \\| actual not lb) = \n-   Negative predictive power: P(actual not lb \\| predict not lb) = \n-   Positive predictive power: P(actual lb \\| predict lb) = \n\n| Actual       | Predict lb | Predict not lb | TOTAL predicted |\n|--------------|------------|----------------|-----------------|\n| Lb           |            |                |                 |\n| Not lb       |            |                |                 |\n| TOTAL actual |            |                |                 |\n\n\\pagebreak\n\n# Part 2\n\nLet's extend the model to use force and height to predict the species (Hn, Cp, and Lb). \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Exercise 8\n\nWrite the equation of the model.\n\n\n$$\\log\\Big(\\frac{\\hat{\\pi}_{Hn}}{\\hat{\\pi}_{Cp}}\\Big) = $$\n\n$$\\log\\Big(\\frac{\\hat{\\pi}_{Lb}}{\\hat{\\pi}_{Cp}}\\Big) = $$\n\n\n## Exercise 9\n\n-   Interpret the intercept for the odds a crab is Hn vs. Cp species.\n\n-   Interpret the effect of force on the odds a crab is Lb vs. Cp species.\n\n## Exercise 10\n\nInterpret the effect of force on the odds a crab is in the Hn vs. Lb species.\n\nCAUTION: We can write an interpretation based on the estimated coefficients; however, we can't make any inferential conclusions for this question based on the current model. We would need to refit the model with Lb as the baseline category to do so.\n\n\\pagebreak\n\n## Exercise 11\n\nConditions for multinomial logistic (and logistic models as well):\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here for other species here\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here for other species here\n```\n:::\n\n\n\\pagebreak\n\n# Part 3\n\n## Checking for multicollinearity in logistic and multinomial logistic\n\nSimilar to multiple linear regression, we can also check for multicollinearity in logistic and multinomial logistic models.\n\n-   Use the `vif` function to check for multicollinearity in logistic regression.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n-   The `vif` function doesn't work for the multinomial logistic regression models, so we can look at a correlation matrix of the predictors as a way to assess if the predictors are highly correlated:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n",
