Predictor: x\n-   Observed y, $y$: truth\n-   Predicted y, $\\hat{y}$: fitted, estimated\n-   Residual: difference between observed and predicted outcome for a given value of predictor\n\n## Model evaluation {.smaller}\n\n-   One concern in evaluating models is how well they do for prediction\n-   We're generally interested in how well a model might do for predicting the outcome for a new observation, not for predicting the outcome for an observation we used to fit the model (and already know its observed value)\n-   Evaluating predictive performance: Split the data into testing and training sets, build models using only the training set, and evaluate their performance on the testing set, and repeat many times to see how your model holds up to \"new\" data\n-   Quantifying variability of of estimates: Bootstrap the data, fit a model, obtain coefficient estimates and/or measures of strength of fit, and repeat many times to see how your model holds up to \"new\" data\n-   Today we introduced these concepts, throughout the semester we'll learn how to implement them (i.e., write the code) and how to interpret their results\n\n## Uninsurance vs. HS graduation in

pull(estimate) %>% round()\n```\n\n-   **Intercept:** Duke Forest houses that are 0 square feet are expected to sell, on average, for `r dollar(intercept)`.\n-   **Slope:** For each additional square foot, the model predicts the sale price of Duke Forest houses to be higher, on average, by `r dollar(slope)`.\n\n## Sample to population {.smaller}\n\n> For each additional square foot, the model predicts the sale price of Duke Forest houses to be higher, on average, by `r dollar(slope)`.\n\n-   This estimate is valid for the single sample of `r nrow(duke_forest)` houses.\n-   But what if we're not interested quantifying the relationship between the size and price of a house in this single sample?\n-   What if we want to say something about the relationship between these variables for all houses in Duke Forest?\n\n## Statistical inference\n\n-   Statistical inference allows provide methods and tools for us to use the single sample we have observed to make valid statements (inferences) about the population it comes from\n\n-   For our inferences to be valid, the sample should be random and representative of the population we're interested in\n\n## Inference for simple linear regression\n\n-   Calculate a confidence interval for the slope, $\\beta_1$\n\n-   Conduct a hypothesis test for the interval, $\\beta_1$\n\n# Confidence interval for the slope\n\n## Confidence interval {.smaller}\n\n-   A plausible range of values for a population parameter is called a **confidence interval**\n-   Using only a single point estimate is like fishing in a murky lake with a spear, and using a confidence interval is like fishing with a net\n    -   We can throw a spear where we saw a fish but we will probably miss, if we toss a net in that area, we have a good chance of catching the fish\n    -   Similarly, if we report a point estimate, we probably will not hit the exact population parameter, but if we report a range of plausible values we have a good shot at capturing the parameter\n\n## Confidence interval for the slope {.smaller}\n\nA confidence interval will allow us to make a statement like \"*For each additional square foot, the model predicts the sale price of Duke Forest houses to be higher, on average, by `r dollar(slope)`, give or take X dollars.*\"\n\n-   Should X be \\$10?\n    \\$100?\n    \\$1000?\n\n-   If we were to take another sample of `r nrow(duke_forest)` would we expect the slope calculated based on that sample to be exactly `r dollar(slope)`?\n    Off by \\$10?\n    \\$100?\n    \\$1000?\n\n-   The answer depends on how variable (from one sample to another sample) the sample statistic (the slope) is\n\n-   We need a way to quantify the variability of the sample statistic\n\n## Quantify the variability of the slope {.smaller}\n\n**for estimation**\n\n-   Two approaches:\n    1.  Via simulation (what we'll do today)\n    2.  Via mathematical models (what we'll do in the next class)\n-   Bootstrapping to quantify the variability of the slope for the purpose of estimation:\n    -   Bootstrap new samples from the original sample\n    -   Fit models to each of the samples and estimate the slope\n    -   Use features of the distribution of the bootstrapped slopes to construct a confidence interval\n\n```{r}\nset.seed(119)\n\ndf_boot_samples_5 <- duke_forest %>%\n  specify(price ~ area) %>%\n  generate(reps = 5, type = \"bootstrap\")\n```\n\n## Bootstrap sample 1\n\n::: columns\n:::

{.smaller}\n\n-   **Population:** Complete set of observations of whatever we are studying, e.g., people, tweets, photographs, etc. (population size = $N$)\n-   **Sample:** Subset of the population, ideally random and representative (sample size = $n$)\n-   Sample statistic $\\ne$ population parameter, but if the sample is good, it can be a good estimate\n-   **Statistical inference:** Discipline that concerns itself with the development of procedures, methods, and theorems that allow us to extract meaning and information from data that has been generated by stochastic (random) process\n-   We report the estimate with a confidence interval, and the width of this interval depends on the variability of sample statistics from different samples from the population\n-   Since we can't continue sampling from the population, we bootstrap from the one sample we have to estimate sampling variability\n\n## Sampling is natural {.smaller}\n\n![](images/lec-5/soup.png){fig-alt=\"Illustration of a

\"Do the data provide sufficient evidence that $\\beta_1$ (the true slope for the population) is different from 0?\"\n-   **Null hypothesis** - $H_0: \\beta_1 = 0$, there is no linear relationship between `area` and `price`\n-   **Alternative hypothesis** - $H_A: \\beta_1 \\ne 0$, there is a linear relationship between `area` and `price`\n\n## Hypothesis testing as a court trial\n\n-   **Null hypothesis**, $H_0$: Defendant is innocent\n-   **Alternative hypothesis**, $H_A$: Defendant is guilty\n-   **Present the evidence:** Collect data\n-   **Judge the evidence:** \"Could these data plausibly have happened by chance if the null hypothesis were true?\"\n    -   Yes: Fail to reject $H_0$\n\n    -   No: Reject $H_0$\n\n## Hypothesis testing framework {.smaller}\n\n-   Start with a null hypothesis, $H_0$ that represents the status quo\n-   Set an alternative hypothesis, $H_A$ that represents the research question, i.e. what we're testing for\n-   Conduct a hypothesis test under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true and calculate a **p-value** (probability of observed or more extreme outcome given that the null hypothesis is true)\n    -   if the test results suggest that the data do not provide convincing evidence for the alternative hypothesis, stick with the null hypothesis\n    -   if they do, then reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative\n"},"formats":{"revealjs":{"execute":{"fig-width":10,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":false,"output":true,"warning":false,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":true,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","html-math-method":{"method":"mathjax","url":"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.0/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_HTML-full"},"slide-level":2,"to":"revealjs","incremental":true,"output-file":"lec-5.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":false,"quarto-version":"0.9.345","auto-stretch":true,"editor":"visual","title":"SLR:
