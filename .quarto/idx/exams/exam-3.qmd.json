You will likely be done quicker but it's best to set aside ample time.\n2.  **Part 2 - Applied:** Data analysis in RStudio and submitted in Gradescope, like a usual lab and homework.\n    -   Go to the [GitHub organization](https://github.com/sta210-s22/) for the course and find the **exam-3-** repo to complete Part 2 of your exam.\n    -   Add your answers to the `exam-3.qmd` file in your repo.\n    -   You can work on this portion at your own pace and come back to it however many times you like until the deadline. I recommend setting aside \\~2 hours. You will likely be done quicker, but it's best to set aside ample time.\n\n**Both portions must be completed and submitted by Mon, April 18 at 11:59 pm**.\nLate work will only be accepted in the case of of extenuating circumstances and notification from your academic dean.\n\nüçÄ Good luck!\nüçÄ\n\n## Academic Integrity\n\nBy taking this exam, you pledge to uphold the Duke Community Standard:\n\n-   I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;\n\n-   I will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and\n\n-   I will act if the Standard is compromised.\n\n## Rules & Notes\n\n-   This is an individual assignment.\n    Everything in your repository and on Sakai is for your eyes only.\n\n-   You may not collaborate or communicate anything about this exam to **anyone** except the instructor and the head TA (Rick Presman).\n    For example, you may not communicate with other students, other TAs, or post/solicit help on the internet, email or via any other method of communication.\n\n-   The exam is open-book, open-note, so you may use any materials from class as you take the exam.\n\n-   Only head TA and professor office hours will be held during the exam period.\n\n-   You may **not** email the TAs questions about the exam.\n\n-   If you have questions, direct message the professor on Slack or email or request an appointment to meet on Zoom.\n\n## Submission\n\n-   **Part 1 - Conceptual:** The answers to the multiple choice/short answer questions should be submitted under *Test & Quizzes* in Sakai.\n\n-   **Part 2 - Applied:** The PDF document for the data analysis portion must be uploaded to Gradescope.\n\n    -   You must submit a PDF to Gradescope that corresponds to the `.qmd` file on your GitHub repository in order to receive credit for this portion of the exam.\n\n    -   You must upload a PDF, not HTML.\n        Any non-PDF submissions will **not** be graded.\n\n    -   Mark the pages associated with each question.\n        If any answer for a question spans multiple pages, mark all associated pages.\n\n    -   Make sure to associate the \"Workflow & formatting\" section with the first page.\n\n    -   Failure to mark the pages in Gradescope will result in point deductions.\n        Any pages that are not marked will **not** be graded.\n\n    -   Make sure that your uploaded PDF document matches your `.qmd` and the PDF in your GitHub repository exactly.\n        Points will be deducted for documents that are not reproducible.\n\n# Grading (50 pts)\n\n| **Part**                             | **Points** |\n|:-------------------------------------|:----------:|\n| **Part 1 - Conceptual** (on Sakai)   |     10     |\n| **Part 2 - Applied** (on Gradescope) |     40     |\n| **Total**                            |     50     |\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"wrap","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"output-file":"exam-3.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"0.9.345","editor":"visual","theme":{"light":["cosmo","../theme.scss"],"dark":["cosmo","../theme-dark.scss"]},"mainfont":"Atkinson Hyperlegible","code-copy":true,"title":"Exam 2","subtitle":"STA 210 - Spring 2022"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
