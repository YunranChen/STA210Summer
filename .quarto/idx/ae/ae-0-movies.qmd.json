Suppose we fit a regression model for each genre that uses budget to predict gross revenue.\n    What are the signs of the correlation between `budget` and `gross` and the slope in each regression equation?\n\n2.  Suppose we fit the regression model from the previous question.\n    Which genre would you expect to have the smallest residuals, on average (*residual = observed revenue - predicted revenue*)?\n\n3.  In the remaining time, discuss the following: Notice in the graph above that `budget` and `gross` are log-transformed.\n    Why are the log-transformed values of the variables displayed rather than the original values (in U.S. dollars)?\n\n## Appendix\n\nBelow is a list of genres in the data set:\n\n```{r}\nmovies %>% \n  distinct(genre) %>%\n  arrange(genre) %>% \n  datatable()\n```\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"wrap","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"output-file":"ae-0-movies.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"0.9.345","editor":"visual","theme":{"light":["cosmo","../theme.scss"],"dark":["cosmo","../theme-dark.scss"]},"mainfont":"Atkinson Hyperlegible","code-copy":true,"title":"Movie budgets and revenues"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
