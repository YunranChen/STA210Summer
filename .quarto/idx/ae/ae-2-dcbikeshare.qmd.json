Why do you think the relationship is strongest in this season?\n-   Which season appears to have the **weakest** relationship between temperature and daily bike rentals? Why do you think the relationship is weakest in this season?\n\n\\[Add your answer here\\]\n\n## Modeling\n\n### Exercise 5\n\nFilter your data for the season with the strongest apparent relationship between temperature and daily bike rentals.\n\n```{r add-chunk-label-3}\n# add code developed during livecoding here\n```\n\n### Exercise 6\n\nUsing the data you filtered in [Exercise 5], fit a linear model for predicting daily bike rentals from temperature for this season.\n\n```{r add-chunk-label-4}\n# add code developed during livecoding here\n```\n\n## Synthesis\n\n### Exercise 7\n\nSuppose you work for a bike share company in Durham, NC, and they want to predict daily bike rentals in 2022.\nWhat is one reason you might recommend they use your analysis for this task?\nWhat is one reason you would recommend they not use your analysis for this task?\n\n\\[Add your answer here\\]\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"wrap","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"output-file":"ae-2-dcbikeshare.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"0.9.345","editor":"visual","theme":{"light":["cosmo","../theme.scss"],"dark":["cosmo","../theme-dark.scss"]},"mainfont":"Atkinson Hyperlegible","code-copy":true,"title":"AE 2: Bike rentals in DC (continued)","subtitle":"Exploring and modeling relationships"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
