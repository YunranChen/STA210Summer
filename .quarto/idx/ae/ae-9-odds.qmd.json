Use age and education to predict if a randomly selected person will vote in the next election.\n\n2.  Use budget and run time (in minutes) to predict a movie's total revenue.\n\n3.  Use age and sex to calculate the probability a randomly selected adult will visit Duke Health in the next year.\n\n## Heart disease\n\n### Data: Framingham study\n\nThis data set is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts.\nWe want to use the total cholesterol to predict if a randomly selected adult is high risk for heart disease in the next 10 years.\n\n-   `high_risk`:\n    -   1: High risk of having heart disease in next 10 years\n    -   0: Not high risk of having heart disease in next 10 years\n-   `totChol`: total cholesterol (mg/dL)\n\n### Outcome: `high_risk`\n\n```{r}\n#| out-width: \"70%\"\n\nggplot(data = heart_disease, aes(x = high_risk)) + \n  geom_bar() + \n  scale_x_discrete(labels = c(\"1\" = \"High risk\", \"0\" = \"Low risk\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of 10-year risk of heart disease\", \n    x = NULL)\n```\n\n```{r}\nheart_disease %>%\n  count(high_risk)\n```\n\n### Calculating probability and odds\n\n1.  What is the probability a randomly selected person in the study is **not** high risk for heart disease?\n\n2.  What are the **odds** a randomly selected person in the study is **not** high risk for heart disease?\n\n### Logistic regression model\n\nFit a logistic regression model to understand the relationship between total cholesterol and risk for heart disease.\n\nLet $pi$ be the probability an adult is high risk.\nThe statistical model is\n\n$$\\log\\Big(\\frac{\\pi_i}{1-\\pi_i}\\Big) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 TotChol_i$$\n\n```{r}\nheart_disease_fit <- logistic_reg() %>%\n  set_engine(\"glm\") %>%\n  fit(high_risk ~ totChol, data = heart_disease, family = \"binomial\")\n\ntidy(heart_disease_fit) %>% kable(digits = 3)\n```\n\n3.  Write the regression equation. Round to 3 digits.\n\n### Calculating log-odds, odds and probabilities\n\nBased on the model, if a randomly selected person has a total cholesterol of 250 mg/dL,\n\n4.  What are the log-odds they are high risk for heart disease?\n\n5.  What are the odds they are high risk for heart disease?\n\n6.  What is the probability they are high risk for heart disease?\n    *Use the odds to calculate your answer.*\n\n### Comparing observations\n\nSuppose a person's cholesterol changes from 250 mg/dL to 200 mg/dL.\n\n7.  How do you expect the log-odds that this person is high risk for heart disease to change?\n\n8.  How do you expect the odds that this person is high risk for heart disease to change?\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"wrap","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"output-file":"ae-9-odds.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"0.9.345","editor":"visual","theme":{"light":["cosmo","../theme.scss"],"dark":["cosmo","../theme-dark.scss"]},"mainfont":"Atkinson Hyperlegible","code-copy":true,"title":"AE 9: Odds"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
