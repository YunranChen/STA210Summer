If so, write the interpretation in the context of the problem. Otherwise, explain why the interpretation is not meaningful.\n\n### Exercise 9\n\nConstruct a 95% confidence interval for the slope using bootstrapping.\nFollow these steps to accomplish this:\n\n-   First set a seed for simulating reproducibly.\n-   Then, simulate the bootstrap distribution of the slope using 1,000 bootstrap samples.\n-   Then, visually estimate the bounds of the bootstrap interval based on a histogram of the distribution of the bootstrapped slopes, using the percentile method.\n-   And then, use the `get_confidence_interval()` function to explicitly calculate the bounds of the confidence interval using the percentile method.\n-   Finally, interpret the confidence interval in the context of the data.\n\n::: render-commit-push\nThis is a good place to render, commit, and push changes to your remote lab repo on GitHub.\nClick the checkbox next to each file in the Git pane to stage the updates you've made, write an informative commit message, and push.\nAfter you push the changes, the Git pane in RStudio should be empty.\n:::\n\n### Exercise 10\n\nFinally, we want to answer the question \"Do the data provide sufficient evidence of a linear relationship between cost and admissions rate, i.e. $\\beta_1$ is different from 0?\"\n\nTo answer this question we will use a hypothesis test.\nWe can conduct a hypothesis test via simulation (what we'll do in this lab) or using mathematical models (what we'll do in the next class).\n\nBefore we can conduct the hypothesis test, let's first set our hypotheses.\nRemember that the null hypothesis represents the status quo (nothing going on, i.e. there is no relationship) and the alternative hypothesis represents our research question (there is something going on, i.e. there is a relationship).\n\n-   $H_0$: There is no linear relationship between the admissions rate and cost of colleges in the United States, $\\beta_1 = 0$\n-   $H_A$: There is a linear relationship between the admissions rate and cost of colleges in the United States, $\\beta_1 \\ne 0$\n\nTo test these hypotheses, we will use a permutation test, where we\n\n-   Simulate new samples from the original sample via permutation under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true\n-   Fit models to each of the samples and estimate the slope\n-   Use features of the distribution of the permuted slopes to calculate the p-value for the hypothesis test\n\nThe major difference between constructing a confidence interval and conducting a hypothesis test is that for the hypothesis test we assume that the null hypothesis is true.\nThis requires a simulation scheme that will allow us to measure the natural variability in the data due to sampling but **not** due to cost and admission rate being correlated by permuting permute one variable to eliminate any existing relationship between the variables.\nTo do so, we randomly assign each `admrate` value to `cost` of a given university, i.e. `cost` and `admrate` are no longer matched for a given university.\n\nIn the following code chunk we\n\n-   First set a seed for simulating reproducibly.\n-   Then, we start with our data frame and specify our model as `cost` vs. `admrate`.\n-   Then, we set our null hypothesis (`cost` and `admrate` are independent)\n-   And then we generate 1000 replicates of our data where, for each replicate, we permute values of `admrate` to randomly assign them to values of `cost`\n-   Finally, we fit our model to each of our 1000 permuted datasets\n\n```{r}\nset.seed(1234)\n\nperm_fits <- scorecard %>%\n  specify(cost ~ admrate) %>%\n  hypothesize(null = \"independence\") %>%\n  generate(reps = 1000, type = \"permute\") %>%\n  fit()\n```\n\nThe resulting dataset `perm_fits` has `nrow(perm_fits)` and `ncol(perm_fits)` columns.\nThe first column, `replicate` indicates the replicate number of the dataset the models were fit to; the values in this column range between 1 and 1000.\nThe second column, `term`, tells us which term (intercept of the model or slope of `admrate`) the `estimate` value in the third column is for.\n\n```{r}\nperm_fits\n```\n\n-   Create a histogram of the slope estimates in `perm_fits`. (Hint: Filter the dataset for just the slope values, `term == \"admrate\".`)\n-   Estimate the p-value of the hypothesis test based on this distribution.\n-   State your conclusion for the test in context.\n-   Indicate whether or not it is consistent with the results of the hypothesis test from the previous exercise.
