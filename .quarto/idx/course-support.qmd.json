make sure you can identify when that is without getting too frustrated and feel comfortable seeking help.\n\n\nIf you have a question during lecture or lab, feel free to ask it!\nThere are likely

are encouraged to attend office hours during the times posted on the home page to ask questions about the course content and assignments.\nA lot of questions are most effectively answered in-person, so office hours are a valuable resource.\nI encourage each and every one of you to take advantage of this resource!\nMake a pledge to stop by office hours at least once during the first three weeks of class.\nIf you truly have no questions to ask, just stop by and say hi and introduce yourself.\nYou can find a list of everyone's office hours [here](/course-team.html).\n\n## Discussion forum\n\nHave a question that can't wait for office hours?\nPrefer to write out your question in detail rather than asking in person?\nThe online discussion forum is the best venue for these!\nWe will use

has already asked a similar question, so please check the other posts on Ed Discussion before adding a new question.\nIf you know the answer to a question that is posted, I encourage you to respond!\n\n## Email\n\nPlease refrain from emailing any course content questions (those should go

not be appropriate for the public course forum (e.g., illness, accommodations, etc.).\nFor such matters, you may email me at [yunran.chen\\@duke.edu](mailto:yunran.chen@duke.edu).\n\nIf there is a question that's not appropriate for the public forum, you are welcome to email me directly.\n**If you email me, please include \"STA 210\" in the subject line.** Barring extenuating circumstances, I
